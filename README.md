# 3DPrinting-Calculator
3DPrinting-Calculator is a lightweight Java Swing desktop application that helps you estimate the total cost of a 3D print in Swedish Kronor (SEK).

Enter your filament usage in grams, filament price per kilogram, printer power consumption (in watts), current electricity price (in öre/kWh), print duration, and any additional fixed costs. The program automatically converts electricity pricing from öre to SEK and shows a detailed cost breakdown, including filament cost, electricity cost per hour, total electricity cost, and total project cost.

Designed for 3D printing in Sweden, but can easily be changed for other regions and currencies.
